# Interactive Data Visualization App

The Interactive Data Visualization App is a web application that allows users to explore and analyze data through dynamic charts. Built using Chart.js, this app provides an intuitive interface for visualizing data trends, comparing values, and making informed decisions.

## Features

- **Drag-and-Drop Interface**: Easily rearrange and customize charts by dragging and dropping data points.
- **Responsive Design**: The app adapts to different screen sizes, ensuring a seamless experience on both desktop and mobile devices.
- **Real-Time Updates**: Charts update dynamically as data changes, providing real-time insights.
- **Customization Options**: Users can customize chart types, colors, and labels to suit their preferences.

## Core Logic

The core logic of the application revolves around the Chart.js library. Key components include:

- **Data Initialization**: Sample data is provided to simulate an API response. You can replace this with actual data from APIs or databases.
- **Chart Configuration**: The `myChart` instance is created with options for chart type (bar chart in this case), responsive layout, and tooltips.
- **Event Handling**: Click events on the chart trigger the `displayInfo` function, which updates the information box with details about the selected data point.
